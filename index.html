<h1>My tech and human journey</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog, I will be sharing my learnings on technology, philosophy and life. Currently learning deep learning and working on projects to apply it. </p>
<p>I am really bad at web and I am doing this blog to understand it a little bit better. </p>
<p>My interests are towards making the worlds and humans better of by leveraging new technologies, and I hope to be alive when we discover how the brain works.</p>
